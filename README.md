# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This is my first published website designed to showcase my projects and skills.

## Overview

This website serves as a platform for displaying my work and expertise. Originally, this project was developed as a Spring Boot application with a small backend functionality for sending messages. However, I decided to simplify the project and focus on the frontend, which now features only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Projects Showcase**: Displaying various projects that I've worked on.
- **Skills Section**: Highlighting my skills and their progress.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is designed to be viewed on both desktop and mobile devices.
